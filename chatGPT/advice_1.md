Becoming a data engineer involves gaining a solid understanding of various data technologies and tools, as well as developing strong programming and database skills. Here's a lean study routine to help you become a data engineer:

**1. Learn the Fundamentals:**
   - **Programming**: Start with a programming language like Python or Java, as these are commonly used in data engineering. Focus on data structures, algorithms, and writing clean, efficient code.
   - **Databases**: Learn the basics of relational databases (SQL) and NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Cassandra. Understand how to design, query, and optimize databases.
   - **Linux/Unix**: Familiarize yourself with the command line and basic shell scripting. Data engineering often involves working in a Unix-like environment.

**2. Study Data Technologies:**
   - **Hadoop Ecosystem**: Learn about Hadoop components like HDFS, MapReduce, and Hadoop ecosystem tools like Hive, Pig, and Spark.
   - **Stream Processing**: Understand stream processing frameworks like Apache Kafka and Apache Flink.
   - **Data Warehousing**: Learn about data warehousing solutions like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake.
   - **ETL Tools**: Familiarize yourself with ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools like Apache Nifi or Talend.

**3. Books and Online Courses:**
   - **Books**:
     - "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann
     - "Hadoop: The Definitive Guide" by Tom White
     - "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney
   - **Online Courses**:
     - Coursera and edX offer data engineering courses from top universities.
     - Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree program is designed for aspiring data engineers.

**4. Practical Experience:**
   - **Personal Projects**: Create your own data engineering projects, like setting up a data pipeline, building a data warehouse, or working with a real dataset.
   - **Internships**: Look for internships or entry-level positions in data-related roles to gain hands-on experience.

**5. Mindset and Soft Skills:**
   - **Problem Solving**: Data engineering often involves solving complex problems, so cultivate your problem-solving skills.
   - **Adaptability**: The field evolves rapidly, so stay open to learning new tools and technologies.
   - **Collaboration**: Effective communication and teamwork are crucial, as you'll often work closely with data scientists, analysts, and other teams.
   - **Attention to Detail**: Precision is essential when dealing with data pipelines and data quality.

**6. Online Platforms and Resources:**
   - Use online learning platforms like Coursera, edX, Udacity, and Pluralsight to access courses and tutorials.
   - Join data engineering communities on platforms like Stack Overflow, Reddit (r/dataengineering), and LinkedIn groups to stay updated and seek advice.

**7. Practice**: Practice coding, database design, and data processing regularly. Leverage platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank for coding challenges.

**8. Build a Portfolio**: Showcase your projects and skills on platforms like GitHub to demonstrate your abilities to potential employers.

Remember that becoming a data engineer is a journey that requires continuous learning and adaptation to new technologies. Stay curious, keep practicing, and seek out opportunities to apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios. Building a strong foundation in programming, databases, and data technologies will be essential as you progress in your data engineering career.
