Lean study routine:

Here is a sample lean study routine for becoming a data engineer:

Start by learning the basics of Python and Scala. There are many online resources available for this.
Once you have a good understanding of the basics, start learning about data engineering tools and frameworks. Again, there are many online resources available for this.
Choose a cloud computing platform to learn. GCP and AWS are the two most popular cloud computing platforms for data engineering.
Start working on data engineering projects. The best way to learn is by doing. There are many open source data engineering projects that you can contribute to.
Build a portfolio of your work. This will help you to land your first data engineering job.
It is important to be consistent with your studies and to focus on the most important topics. You should also take breaks and avoid overworking yourself.

Here are some additional tips for creating a lean study routine:

Set realistic goals. Don't try to learn everything at once. Set small, achievable goals for yourself.
Create a schedule and stick to it. Schedule time for studying each day or week.
Find a study buddy or group. Studying with others can help you to stay motivated and to learn from each other.
Take breaks. It is important to take breaks while studying to avoid burnout.
Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you are struggling with a topic, reach out to a friend, classmate, or online forum for help.
Becoming a data engineer takes time and effort, but it is a rewarding career. By following a lean study routine, you can learn the skills you need to become a data engineer in a timely and efficient manner.
