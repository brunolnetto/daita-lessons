Lean Study Routine for Data Engineers

Start with the fundamentals. Before you can dive into data engineering, you need to have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of computer science, software engineering, and mathematics. This includes topics such as data structures, algorithms, databases, and statistics. There are many great resources available online and in libraries to help you learn these topics.

Focus on the most important skills. Not all data engineering skills are created equal. Some skills are more essential than others for entry-level jobs. These include:

Programming languages: Python and Scala are the most popular programming languages for data engineers.
Cloud computing platforms: AWS, Azure, and GCP are the three major cloud computing platforms. Data engineers need to be familiar with at least one of these platforms.
Big data technologies: Hadoop, Spark, and Hive are the most popular big data technologies. Data engineers need to be able to use these technologies to store and process large datasets.
Learn by doing. The best way to learn data engineering is by doing. Build projects that use the skills you are learning. This will help you solidify your understanding of the concepts and gain practical experience.

Main Platforms and Tools

Programming languages: Python and Scala
Cloud computing platforms: AWS, Azure, and GCP
Big data technologies: Hadoop, Spark, and Hive
Data warehouses: Snowflake, Redshift, and BigQuery
Data visualization tools: Tableau, Power BI, and Looker
Books

Data Pipelines: Designing and Building Scalable Streaming Data Pipelines by Yanpei Chen and Bill Chambers
Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems by Martin Kleppmann
Machine Learning Engineering: Building Modern Data Infrastructure and Pipelines by Damon Edwards
Mindset

Be curious. Data engineers are constantly learning new things. They need to be curious about the latest technologies and trends in the field.
Be problem-solvers. Data engineers are often tasked with solving complex problems. They need to be able to think critically and come up with creative solutions.
Be collaborators. Data engineers often work with other engineers, scientists, and product managers. They need to be able to communicate effectively and collaborate with others to achieve common goals.
Lean Study Routine

Here is a sample lean study routine for data engineers:

Morning: Spend 30 minutes reviewing the fundamentals of computer science, software engineering, and mathematics. You can use online resources, textbooks, or other resources to review these topics.
Afternoon: Spend 2 hours working on a data engineering project. This could be a personal project or a project for work or school.
Evening: Spend 1 hour reading a book or article about data engineering. This will help you stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies in the field.
You can adjust this routine to fit your own needs and schedule. The important thing is to be consistent with your studies and to focus on the most important skills.

Additional Tips

Find a mentor. A mentor can provide you with guidance and support as you learn data engineering. They can also help you connect with other people in the field.
Join a community. There are many online and offline communities for data engineers. Joining a community is a great way to learn from others, ask questions, and get feedback on your work.
Contribute to open source projects. Contributing to open source projects is a great way to gain experience working on real-world data engineering problems. It is also a great way to network with other data engineers.
Becoming a data engineer takes time and effort, but it is a rewarding career path. By following the tips above, you can develop the skills and knowledge you need to become a successful data engineer.
