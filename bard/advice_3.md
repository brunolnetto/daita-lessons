Be able to work independently and as part of a team.
Be able to communicate complex ideas clearly and concisely.
Lean Study Routine

Set realistic goals. Don't try to learn everything at once. Start with the basics and gradually build your knowledge and skills over time.
Focus on the most important topics. Not all topics are created equal. Some topics are more essential for data engineers than others. Focus your time and energy on learning the most important topics first.
Use a variety of learning resources. There are many different ways to learn about data engineering. Take advantage of online courses, tutorials, books, and articles.
Be consistent with your studies. It's better to study for a short time every day than to cram everything into one long session.
Apply what you learn. The best way to learn is by doing. Try to find opportunities to apply what you're learning to real-world projects.
Here is a sample lean study routine that you can follow:

Week 1: Learn the basics of Python programming.
Week 2: Learn the basics of SQL.
Week 3: Learn the basics of cloud computing (AWS or Azure).
Week 4: Learn the basics of Hadoop and Spark.
Week 5: Learn the basics of data warehousing and data lakes.
Week 6: Learn the basics of data visualization.
Week 7: Start working on a real-world data engineering project.
This is just a sample routine, of course. You can adjust it to fit your own needs and learning style.

Additional Tips

Find a mentor. A mentor can provide you with guidance and support as you learn about data engineering.
Join a community. There are many online and offline communities for data engineers. Joining a community can help you stay motivated and learn from others.
Contribute to open source projects. Contributing to open source projects is a great way to gain experience in data engineering and build your portfolio.
Conclusion

Becoming a data engineer takes time and effort, but it is a rewarding career. By following the tips above, you can develop a lean study routine that will help you achieve your goals.
