# Mindset

To become a data engineer, you need to have a strong analytical mind and be able to think critically about data. You should also be a good problem solver and be able to work independently and as part of a team. Additionally, you need to be able to learn new things quickly and be adaptable to change.

# Platforms and Tools

Data engineers use a variety of platforms and tools to do their jobs. Some of the most common include:

- **Programming languages:** Python, Scala, Java, SQL
- **Cloud computing platforms:** AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Big data processing frameworks:** Spark, Hadoop
- **Data warehousing and analytics tools:** Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery
- **Machine learning platforms:** TensorFlow, PyTorch

# Books

Here are a few books that can help you learn about data engineering:

- *Data Engineering on AWS: Building Data Pipelines with Python and SQL* by Willian T. Polk
- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Data Architecture Blueprint* by Martin Kleppmann
- *Machine Learning Engineering: Building Scalable, Maintainable ML Systems* by Connie Zhuo

# Lean Study Routine

Here is a lean study routine that you can follow to become a data engineer:

1. **Choose a learning platform:** There are many online learning platforms that offer courses on data engineering. Choose a platform that is well-regarded and has a good selection of courses.

2. **Create a study plan:** Decide what topics you need to learn and how much time you can commit to studying each week. Create a schedule that will help you reach your goals.

3. **Focus on the essentials:** Don't try to learn everything about data engineering at once. Focus on the most important topics, such as programming languages, cloud computing platforms, and big data processing frameworks.

4. **Get hands-on experience:** The best way to learn data engineering is by doing. Complete projects and tutorials to gain hands-on experience with the different platforms and tools that you are learning about.

5. **Don't be afraid to ask for help:** If you get stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from your instructor, classmates, or online communities.

# Additional Tips

Here are a few additional tips for becoming a data engineer:

- Network with other data engineers. Attend meetups and conferences to connect with other data engineers. This is a great way to learn from their experiences and get advice on your career.

- Contribute to open source projects. Contributing to open source projects is a great way to gain experience working on real-world data engineering problems.

- Build a portfolio. Showcase your skills and experience by building a portfolio of projects. This will help you stand out to potential employers.

Becoming a data engineer takes time and effort, but it is a rewarding career path. By following the tips above, you can create a lean study routine that will help you reach your goals.
