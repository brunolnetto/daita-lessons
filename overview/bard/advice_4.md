# Lean Study Routine to Become a Data Engineer

To become a data engineer in a lean way, you should focus on the most important skills and knowledge that are required for the job. Here is a lean study routine:

## Platforms:

- **Cloud computing platform:** Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- **Big data processing platform:** Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, or Apache Hive.
- **Data warehousing platform:** Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake.

## Tools:

- **Programming languages:** Python or Scala.
- **Data visualization tools:** Tableau or Power BI.
- **Version control system:** Git.

## Books:

- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann
- *Data Warehousing Fundamentals* by Ralph Kimball and Margy Ross
- *Machine Learning for Software Engineers* by Stephan Thiel

## Mindset:

- Be curious and eager to learn. The field of data engineering is constantly evolving, so it is important to be proactive about staying up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies.
- Be able to think critically and solve problems. Data engineers often have to deal with complex data challenges, so it is important to be able to think critically and come up with solutions.
- Be able to work effectively as part of a team. Data engineers often collaborate with other data scientists, software engineers, and product managers, so it is important to be able to work effectively as part of a team.

## Study routine:

1. Start by learning the basics of cloud computing, big data processing, and data warehousing. You can find many online resources and tutorials on these topics.

2. Once you have a good understanding of the basics, start learning the programming languages and tools that are used by data engineers. You can find many online courses and tutorials on these topics.

3. Read the books listed above to learn more about the theory and practice of data engineering.

4. Work on personal projects to practice your skills and build a portfolio. You can find many data engineering projects on GitHub and other websites.

5. Contribute to open source data engineering projects. This is a great way to gain experience and learn from other data engineers.

## Tips:

- Focus on the most important skills and knowledge. Don't try to learn everything about data engineering at once. Focus on the skills and knowledge that are most relevant to the types of data engineering jobs you are interested in.
- Be consistent with your studies. Set aside some time each day to study data engineering. Even if you can only study for 30 minutes a day, it will add up over time.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you are stuck on a concept or project, don't be afraid to ask for help from a mentor, friend, or online community.

By following this lean study routine, you can become a data engineer in a relatively short amount of time.
