# Lean Study Routine to Become a Data Engineer

To become a data engineer, you need to have a strong foundation in computer science, software engineering, math, and statistics. You also need to be familiar with big data technologies and tools.

## Lean Study Routine

### Platforms:

- **Coursera:** Coursera offers a variety of online courses on data engineering, including courses from top universities such as Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley.
- **Udemy:** Udemy also offers a variety of online courses on data engineering, including courses from experienced data engineers.
- **Kaggle:** Kaggle is a great platform to learn data engineering by working on real-world data science problems.
- **GitHub:** GitHub is a platform where you can find and contribute to open source data engineering projects.

### Tools:

- **Python:** Python is a popular programming language for data engineering. It is easy to learn and has a wide range of libraries and tools for data science.
- **SQL:** SQL is a language used to query and manipulate data in relational databases. It is an essential skill for data engineers.
- **Hadoop:** Hadoop is a framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets. It is a popular choice for big data applications.
- **Spark:** Spark is a framework for distributed processing of large datasets. It is faster than Hadoop and easier to use.

### Books:

- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications:* This book provides a comprehensive overview of data engineering. It covers topics such as data modeling, data storage, data processing, and data analysis.
- *Data Engineering on AWS:* This book provides a guide to using Amazon Web Services (AWS) for data engineering. It covers topics such as building data pipelines, running data processing jobs, and storing data on AWS.
- *Spark: The Definitive Guide:* This book provides a comprehensive overview of Apache Spark. It covers topics such as Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, and Spark MLlib.

### Mindset:

- Be curious: Data engineers need to be curious about data and how it can be used to solve problems. They should be constantly asking questions and looking for new ways to improve their data pipelines and data models.
- Be a problem solver: Data engineers need to be able to identify and solve problems with data. They should be able to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions.
- Be a team player: Data engineers often work with other data engineers, software engineers, and data scientists. They need to be able to collaborate effectively and communicate their ideas clearly.
